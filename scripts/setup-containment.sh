# Everything else in this project derives the project root at runtime
# (scripts/lib/project-env.sh, the run-mcp-*.sh launchers, scripts/verdict, the
# hooks) so they already work from any CWD and stay inside this folder. The one
# piece that can't self-derive is Claude Code's `env` block in
# .claude/settings.local.json: it must hold absolute paths, and Claude Code does
# NOT expand variables there.
#
# This script regenerates that env block from project-env.sh for wherever the
# folder currently lives. Run it once after you clone or move the project:
#
#     bash scripts/setup-containment.sh
#
# It is itself path-agnostic (derives the repo from its own location) and writes
# nothing outside the project. Re-running is idempotent.

# (e.g. a previously-loaded project's env) would be copied verbatim and the
# regenerated block would point at the wrong place. So unset the derived vars
# first, forcing project-env.sh to compute them fresh from ${REPO}.
