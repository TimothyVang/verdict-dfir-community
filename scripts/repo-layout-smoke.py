"""repo-layout-smoke - assert no un-sanctioned entry lives at the repo root.

VERDICT already guards the *published* surface (.githooks/pre-push,
scripts/ship-beta.sh, .gitattributes export-ignore). What it lacked was a
guard for *where files live in the working tree*. Nothing stopped a stray
asset folder, a loose scratch note, or a duplicate `*_asset_folder/` from
landing at the repo root and sitting in `git status` forever - which is
exactly how the root accumulated `verdict_svg_asset_folder/` +
`verdict_dfir_svg_asset_folder.zip` (stale duplicates of the canonical
`VERDICT_DFIR_SVG_Assets_v2/`).

This smoke locks the root layout: the repo root may only contain
explicitly-sanctioned config files, public docs, and known top-level
directories (ROOT_ALLOWLIST). Anything else that is tracked OR untracked-
but-not-ignored is a violation.

Scope is the repo root ONLY (the stated pain point). Entries that git
already ignores - runtime drops like `*.ova`, plaso `log2timeline-*` /
`psort-*` logs, `evidence/`, `tmp/`, `target/`, `node_modules/`,
`release-assets/`, `graphify-out/` - are intentionally out of scope: they
never enter git and the layout doc documents where they go.

To fix a failure: move the entry into a sanctioned subtree (scripts/,
docs/, assets/, ...), add it to .gitignore if it's local-only output, or -
if it is genuinely a new sanctioned root citizen - add its exact name to
ROOT_ALLOWLIST below with a one-line justification comment. Same convention
as the ALLOW_PATTERNS list in scripts/path-existence-smoke.py.

Wall-clock: ~30ms (two `git` calls + set membership). Wired into
scripts/run-all-smokes.sh beside path-existence-smoke.
