# scripts/run-all-smokes.sh — run local smoke/lint/test gates outside docker.
#
# A developer iterating locally on the typed MCP surface, find-evil-auto's
# verdict policy, fleet_correlate's filter logic, or the demo script's
# timing should not have to wait for a docker compose build to find out
# they broke something. This script complements docker/l1-compose.yml
# with a fast local gate and final tally; Docker still runs broader
# cargo/pytest/pnpm checks in an Ubuntu container.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/run-all-smokes.sh
#
# Exits 0 if every smoke passed; non-zero if any failed.
#
# Pre-flight: requires `cargo build --release -p findevil-mcp` (the Rust
# smoke resolves the release binary under `${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}`) and
# `uv sync` in services/agent_mcp (the agent_mcp smoke spawns the Python MCP server).
