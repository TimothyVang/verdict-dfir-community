// EducationalExplainer — "What VERDICT is and why you can trust it." A calm,
// concept-first walkthrough for someone who has never seen the tool. Narration
// is the canonical voiceover (read by the TTS step); on-screen text is the
// concise headline/points. Every claim is scoped to the product guardrails
// (CLAUDE.md): NO_EVIL is never a clean bill of health, no tool runs arbitrary
// commands, and every finding is tool-cited and verified.
