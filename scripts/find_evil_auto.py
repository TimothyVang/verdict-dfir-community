"""find-evil-auto — single-command automated investigation orchestrator.

Usage:
    python scripts/find_evil_auto.py <evidence_path> [--unattended] [--no-report] [--run-summary <path>]

What it does:
    1. Detects evidence type (memory image, EVTX, disk image,
       Velociraptor zip, or mixed evidence directory)
    2. Spawns findevil-mcp + findevil-agent-mcp inside the SIFT VM via SSH stdio
    3. case_open against the evidence (real SHA-256, audit log starts here)
    4. Runs the per-type playbook tool sequence
    5. Synthesizes Pool A vs Pool B Findings deterministically from tool outputs
       (Pool A = persistence-biased framing; Pool B = exfil/general-malware framing)
    6. detect_contradictions surfaces disagreements
    7. judge_findings + correlate_findings (SOUL.md ≥2 rule)
    8. manifest_finalize: Merkle tree + signed manifest
    9. Writes verdict.json + (optional) PDF report (the report
       surfaces the findings, ATT&CK coverage, and audit chain).

This is the headless investigation engine behind `scripts/verdict` — point
at evidence, get a signed verdict. No interactive Claude Code session required.

Designed to run as a one-shot from the Windows host. Re-runs are
idempotent on a fresh case_id; the same evidence file produces the
same SHA-256 (chain of custody) but a fresh case_id and fresh manifest.

# annotates an uncorroborated malfind lead with a benign-candidate HINT; it NEVER
# asserts malice and NEVER changes a finding's tier (the >=2-artifact-class gate is
# what promotes a malfind hit). SAFE direction is "not benign": any injection signal
# (MZ header / shellcode prologue) or a non-runtime owner returns None. LOLBin hosts
# (powershell/mshta/rundll32/...) JIT too but are prime injection vectors, so they are
