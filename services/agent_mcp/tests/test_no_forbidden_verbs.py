"""Architectural guard: neither product MCP server registers a forbidden verb.

VERDICT's core safety claim is "no ``execute_shell``; typed read-only
surface" (see ``CLAUDE.md`` Tool Surface Boundary and the Rust crate's
``//! - No execute_shell tool, ever.`` invariant). This test turns that
prose claim into an enforced regression guard: it enumerates the
*actually registered* product tool names from BOTH product servers and
asserts none of them is a bare execution-or-mutation verb.

Source-of-truth driven, not a hardcoded duplicate list:

* Python (``findevil-agent-mcp``, 13 tools) — imported from the live
  registry via :func:`findevil_agent_mcp.tools.all_specs`.
* Rust (``findevil-mcp``, 32 tools) — parsed out of the registration
  site ``services/mcp/src/server.rs`` (``build_registry()``), which is
  the single place the wire-level tool names are declared.

A future regression — someone wiring up an ``execute_shell`` /
``write_file`` / ``run_command`` style tool on either server — fails
this test with a message naming the offending tool and its server.

The two operator-convenience MCP servers (playwright, puppeteer, n8n,
qmd) are intentionally NOT covered: they can never emit Findings or
audit-chain tool calls, so they are outside the product safety
boundary this guard protects.

# ``executeShell`` are caught. We do NOT match these as substrings of an
# unrelated word (e.g. ``evtx_query`` must not trip ``rm`` via "q-rm"), so
