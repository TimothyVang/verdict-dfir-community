"""Pure ground-truth accuracy-scoring core — the single source of truth.

This module holds the *domain logic* for grading a finished Case against a curated
ground-truth golden: recall, precision/F1, hallucination rate, verdict consistency,
planted-bait detection, and negative-assertion coverage. It is offline and
read-only — it reads a case directory's ``verdict.json`` and a matching
``goldens/<id>/expected-findings.json`` and returns a plain report dict. It never
touches the sealed audit chain and is never part of the investigation pipeline.

Two callers share this one core (no logic fork):

  * ``scripts/score-recall.py`` — the hyphenated maintainer/grading CLI, which
    imports :func:`score` (and the resolver helpers) and adds only the CLI/printing
    layer; and
  * the ``accuracy_compare`` MCP shim — a read-only, audit-chained *diagnostic*
    tool. It is NOT a Finding: per CLAUDE.md, optional automation/scoring sidecars
    are never evidence and never create Findings, so the shim appends only a
    non-Finding ``accuracy_diagnostic`` audit record.

Matching: an expected finding is RECALLED when some run finding covers enough of
its distinctive description/artifact-hint tokens (coverage over the expected token
set, not symmetric Jaccard, so a verbose-but-correct run finding still matches a
concise ground-truth claim). MITRE technique is deliberately not a match shortcut.

Precision: a run finding matched to no expected claim is ``extra``. On an
``exhaustive`` (closed-world) key every extra is a false positive; on an open-world
key an extra is only PROVABLY wrong when it asserts a planted ``anti_fact``, a
``known_negative`` (benign IOC-lookalike), or a ``named_claim_denylist`` term.

Negative-assertion coverage: of the negative assertions a correct run must AVOID
(every ``anti_fact`` / ``known_negative`` / denylisted name in the key), how many
did the run correctly stay away from. 100% coverage means zero planted-bait
hallucinations.
