"""Run manifest assembly + verification.

Spec #2 §7.1 + §7.2. Ties the current custody layers together:

  * walks the hash-chained ``audit.jsonl``
  * extracts every ``tool_call_output_hash`` and every approved-
    finding hash into a Merkle tree
  * asks the ``Signer`` to sign the canonicalized manifest body
  * writes ``run.manifest.json``

Verification is the symmetric operation:

  * ``audit.verify()`` replays the chain
  * ``MerkleTree`` rebuilds from the leaves declared in the
    manifest, comparing the recomputed root to the manifest's
    ``merkle_root``
  * the signature tier is reported honestly: Ed25519 is verified
    cryptographically offline, Sigstore is recorded for an
    identity-aware verifier, and stub remains a dev placeholder
