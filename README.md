# VERDICT — Community & Contribution Hub

This is the **community front door** for **VERDICT**, a digital-forensics & incident-response (DFIR)
agent that runs inside [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). The code lives in the main
project repo — **this repo is where you find the open problems, file ideas, ask questions, and pick
something to work on.**

> VERDICT shipped at a SANS AI hackathon. It works, the core idea holds up — and it can be a lot
> better. I'd rather build it in the open with people who know DFIR and AI than grind it solo. If
> that's you: welcome, and thank you.

**Where things live**

| You want to… | Go here |
|---|---|
| Read the code / build it | the project repo (see *Project links* below) |
| Pick an open problem, file an idea, ask a question | **right here** — [open an issue](../../issues/new/choose) |
| Understand the design deeply | the project's `docs/` and published docs site (links below) |

> **Note on timing.** The public release repo is in a judging freeze, so code changes are landing on
> the **dev** repo (`TimothyVang/sans-hackathon`) and promote to release after judging closes. File
> issues and discussion here anytime; code PRs target the dev repo until the freeze lifts.

## What VERDICT is (the 90-second version)

There's no separate app server — the Claude Code session *is* the engine. You point VERDICT at
evidence (a memory image, Windows Event Logs, a disk image, a packet capture, or a whole multi-host
case folder) and it:

1. opens a read-only **Case** and SHA-256s the evidence,
2. drives a **narrow, typed, read-only** tool surface (43 product tools — 31 Rust DFIR tools + 12
   Python crypto/memory tools; **no `execute_shell`, ever**),
3. **verifies every Finding** (re-runs the cited tool and compares output hashes),
4. and writes a **scoped verdict** — `SUSPICIOUS` / `INDETERMINATE` / `NO_EVIL` — plus an analyst
   report, sealed into a **hash-chained, signed manifest you can verify offline**.

It is **not** an autonomous responder (the analyst approves the plan; the verifier re-runs every
cited tool before any Finding reaches the report), and `NO_EVIL` is never a whole-environment clean
bill — only "no reportable Finding in the artifacts actually examined." That scoping discipline is
the point.

  `SUSPICIOUS` verdict, verifiable offline.

More screen captures — investigation GIFs, the live dashboard, the multi-host fleet rollup — are in
the project repo's README (see *Project links*).

## The hard problem we want help with: keeping the AI honest

The thing that is **not** fully solved is the one everybody worries about with an LLM doing
forensics: **hallucination.** A language model will, given the chance, confidently assert that a
binary ran or data was exfiltrated when the evidence doesn't support it.

VERDICT's bet is that you don't fix this with a better prompt — you fix it **architecturally**, so a
hallucination *can't survive into the verdict* unless it passes gates that re-check it against
re-runnable tool output and corroborating artifacts:

- **Citation or it didn't happen** — every Finding cites a `tool_call_id`; uncited claims are vetoed.
- **Verifier replay** — the verifier re-runs each cited tool and compares output hashes; drift
  downgrades or rejects the Finding. Replay is deterministic, so the audit chain attests exactly what
  the model saw.
- **Two biased pools + contradiction surfacing** — a persistence-biased and an exfil-biased pool work
  the same evidence; disagreements are flagged *before* the judge merges.
- **The ≥2-artifact-class rule** — any "this ran" / "this was exfiltrated" claim needs two distinct
  evidence classes or it's downgraded to `HYPOTHESIS`. Hayabusa/Sigma/YARA/malfind are leads, not
  facts.
- **A confidence taxonomy + coverage manifest + signed custody** make the limits explicit instead of
  papering over them.

**It works — but it doesn't drive the false-positive rate to zero, and the gates have gaps.** That's
where contributors come in.

## Where you can help (open problems)

These are where help is most useful right now — each one is grounded in the project's own limitation
docs (`false-positives.md`, `architecture.md`), not a wishlist. Want to tackle something else, or
think a priority is off? Open an issue and say so.

| Area | What's open | Skills | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FP floor / calibration** | Not zero-FP against the clean benign baseline. Auto-detect the rule that fired, propose a tune-out, track the FP floor over time. | DFIR, Sigma/YARA tuning, Python | medium |
| **DKOM vs. acquisition smear** | `vol_pslist`/`vol_psscan` divergence looks like a rootkit but is often a corrupt/smeared capture. Disambiguating it reliably is hard. | memory forensics, Volatility 3 | hard |
| **Prompt-injection at the evidence boundary** | Attacker-controlled evidence text is neutralized at the MCP output boundary. New evasion classes / a fuzz corpus would harden it. | security, Rust/Python | medium |
| **Coverage breadth** | More evidence types and parsers (macOS/Linux artifacts, more cloud sources) behind the typed tool surface — never `execute_shell`. | DFIR tooling, Rust | medium |
| **Evaluation corpus** | A bigger public set of golden cases + a metric for "did the agent over-claim?" so improvements are measurable. | DFIR, eval/benchmarking | research |
| **Cross-host FP filters** | Filter more enterprise EDR/agent stacks so they don't read as lateral movement. | IR at scale, Python | good-first |
| **Docs & onboarding** | Make a first run frictionless for a newcomer. | technical writing | good-first |

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue here first** for anything non-trivial (templates: *Pick an open problem*,
   *Question / discussion*) so we agree on the approach before you spend a weekend on it.
2. **Build/test/submit mechanics** (CI tiers, conventional commits, the live-run "done" gate) live in
   the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` — see *Project links*.
3. **Invariants a PR must not break** (so your work isn't wasted): no `execute_shell` tool; every
   Finding cites a `tool_call_id`; evidence is read-only; Claude Code is the orchestrator;
   AGPL/GPL DFIR tools stay subprocess-only. Full list in the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
